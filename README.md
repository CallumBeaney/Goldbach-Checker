Goldbach's Conjecture asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is equal to the sum of two primes.
Input threshold integer to check for an exception: 100000001 
Checking up to 100000000...

There are       [49999999] even numbers in the range (4 - 100000000).
                [49999999] fulfilled Goldbach's Conjecture in this check.
